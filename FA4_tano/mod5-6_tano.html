            <h3>Jamming to "Fields of Gold" by Sting</h3>
            <p>You'll remember me when the west wind moves<br>
                Upon the fields of barley<br>
                You'll forget the sun in his jealous sky<br>
                As we walk in fields of gold </p>
            <p>So she took her love<br>
                For to gaze awhile<br>
                Upon the fields of barley<br>
                In his arms she fell as her hair came down<br>
                Among the fields of gold</p>
            <p>Will you stay with me, will you be my love<br>
                Among the fields of barley<br>
                We'll forget the sun in his jealous sky<br>
                As we lie in fields of gold</p>
        </div>
