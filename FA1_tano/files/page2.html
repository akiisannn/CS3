            <h1>Taylor Swift- Cruel Summer</h1><hr>
            <p><span><ul>
                <li>On August 23, 2019, Taylor Swift released Cruel Summer, the second track from her full album "Lover"</li><br>
                <li>I discovered this song by shuffling all of Taylor's songs and i loved it at first listen. The song has this nostalgic<br>
                    and ecstatic feeling.</li><br>
                <li>The song talks about romance during summer and the difficulties the singer experienced during the romance.<br>
                    The hook is so catchy and satisfying to listen to that I can't get enough of it!<br>
                    The lyric "I love you. Ain't that the worst thing you ever heard?" hits so hard too. Since this<br>
                    song talks about the pain in summer romance, it makes sense that the lyrics has this kind of<br>
                    regret or realization that love is complicated.<br></li>
                </ul></span></p>
