            <p><span><ul>
                <li>On February 12, 2019, TXT released the acoustic mix of one of their debut songs, Our Summer.</li><br>
                <li>I discovered this song when listening to their debut single for the first time. The song is very bright<br>
                    and innocent sounding, that it brightens my day.</li><br>
                <li>The song talks about a person that makes you feel like it's summer everytime with their love. <br>
                    The song has a carefree feeling and the lyrics also reflect that, such as the lyrics <br>
                    "Blooming gold season, like our summer/No matter where you are, no matter what season/If we're together, feel like summer"<br></li>
                </ul></span></p>
