            <h1>NIKI- Backburner</h1><hr>
            <p><span><ul>
                <li>On August 12, 2022, NIKI released Backburner, the third track from her full album "Nicole"</li><br>
                <li>I discovered this song while streaming the entire album because I was already a fan of NIKI.<br>
                    I love the chorus and word plays from Reformation, and it makes more sense to me now that<br>
                    we just learned about it in social science.</li><br>
                <li>The song talks about being used by your partner only when they need something from you.<br>
                    Because backburner means "low priority" or "not important," when NIKI sings "But guess<br>
                    I won't ever mind crisping up on your backburner," she means that she will stay even though<br>
                    she is considered low priority. The song is not romantically relatable to me, but it is relatable<br>
                    to my social life. I like the song because of the lyricism and the use of wordplay, particularly<br>
                    the line "Hey! Are you still there?" because the song becomes choppy as if she is being disconnected.</li>
